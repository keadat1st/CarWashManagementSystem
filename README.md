**SuperShine is a self-service car wash. Your job is to develop a car wash system for SuperShine.**


**This is how the business work at SuperShine and high level requirements for the new system:**


* Customers buy an electronic WashCard that contains a value of washes for 200 -1000 kr.
* When customers want to wash their car; they insert their card into the machine and chose a specific wash type. The price of the wash is then deducted from the card.
* Customers can recharge their card with an amount up to 1000 kr by inserting their credit card and their WashCard into the machine.
* Customers can check the amount left on their card by inserting it into the machine.
* Customers can have a receipt printed if they wish
* The Owner would like to have statistics of the washes
* The System should be able to handle wash types and prices

## Software Design
* Create a FURPS+ list for the system
* Create a Kanban board with the ToDo tasks for this project period
* Identify Actors and Use Cases for the system. The use cases should be in casual format (not brief).
* Create System Sequence Diagrams based your central Use Cases
* Create a Noun List from your Use Cases.
* Create a Verb List from your Use Cases.
* Create a Domain Model with relations and multiplicity based on you Noun List.
* Create a Class Diagram for the Car Wash Management System.

## Software construction
**We will have a class discussion about the structure of the Java program and based on the discussion and the developed artifacts from Software Design, you will develop part of the designed system.**


* The system must be able to handle that a customer can only buy the car wash if she/he has enough money on his WashCard.
